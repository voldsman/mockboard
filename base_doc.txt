--INITIAL DOC, TO BE REWORKED--

Running the Application
Start the Mockboard.dev application using Docker Compose:
> docker-compose up -d

This will start the mock server and make it available on your local machine.

Accessing the Web Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8888

The Mockboard.dev UI will appear, displaying:
The Base URL for accessing mock endpoints
Your unique API Key that will be used to route requests to your mocks

Creating Mock Endpoints
Use the web interface to create your mock endpoints. You can define:
- The endpoint path (e.g., `/api/users`)
- HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Response headers (optional)
- Response body (JSON)
- Response status code
- Response delay (optional)

Example: Create a mock endpoint with the path `/api/users` that returns a list of users.

Using Your Mock Endpoints
Once you've created a mock endpoint, you can access it using your API client, cURL or application code etc.
All mock endpoints follow this pattern:
http://localhost:8888/m/{apiKey}/{mockPath}
Where:
{apiKey} is your unique API key shown in the UI
{mockPath} is the path you defined for your mock endpoint

Example:
If you created a mock endpoint `/api/users`, access it at:
http://localhost:8888/m/{apiKey}/api/users
